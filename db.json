projects = {
	id: Index (starting from 1xxxx), Autoincreament,
	source: String,
	content: String,
	className: String,
	balance: Int,
	start: Date,
	end: Date
}


other_projects = {
	id: Index (starting from 9xxxx), Autoincreament,
	source: "department",
	content: "Rotating Quota 1",
	className: 'code90001',
}

I will concat projects and other_projects into all_project.

items = {
	id: Index (starting from 1), Autoincreament, 
	project_id: FK(all_project),
	content: FK(all_project), 
	title: FK(all_project), 
	start: Date,
	end: Date,
	group: Int,
	amount: Int,
	className: FK(all_project),
}
